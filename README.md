⚖️ Proof of Justice (PoJ): The Future of Legal Transparency via NFTs 

 NFT-Based Decentralized Legal Record System 

PoJ is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Ethereum blockchain to bring transparency and traceability to legal case judgements using NFTs. It aims to provide an immutable, tamper-proof system where judgements are tokenized as NFTs and stored on-chain. 

🛠 Tech Stack 

Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript 

Smart Contracts: Solidity (ERC-721 Standard) 

Blockchain: Ethereum (Sepolia Testnet) 

Wallet: MetaMask 

IDE: Visual Studio Code 

Smart Contract Testing & Deployment: Remix IDE 

Decentralized Storage: IPFS (via Pinata) 

Blockchain Interaction: Web3.js 

 

⚙️ Tools & Dependencies 

Solidity: Language used to write smart contracts 

Remix IDE: For developing, compiling, and deploying contracts 

MetaMask: Wallet integration for user authentication and transactions 

Web3.js: Communicating frontend with blockchain 

IPFS via Pinata: Storing metadata and legal judgement files in a decentralized manner 

Pinata SDK: For uploading files and JSON metadata to IPFS 

Visual Studio Code: Frontend development 

OpenZeppelin: ERC-721 standards and access control modules 

 

Features & Functionalities 

✅ Tokenize legal judgements as NFTs 

✅ Upload and pin judgement documents to IPFS 

✅ Mint NFTs to designated legal authorities or parties 

✅ Verify authenticity and ownership of a judgement on-chain 

✅ View case metadata and IPFS-stored documents directly on frontend 

✅ Secure, transparent, and tamper-proof recordkeeping 

✅ Only admin/authorized entity can mint or update judgement NFTs 

 

🔁 Workflow 

User Uploads Case Details → 
 A PDF judgment is uploaded to Pinata, which pins the file to IPFS and returns a hash (CID). 

Admin Mints NFT → 
 Admin mints NFT to a party's address, linking the judgement metadata to the Pinata IPFS hash. 

Verification → 
 Any user can verify authenticity by viewing metadata on-chain and opening the file via the IPFS gateway URL from Pinata. 

 

🧪 Testing & Deployment 

Smart contracts were written and deployed using Remix IDE. 

MetaMask was used to connect to Sepolia Testnet for all blockchain transactions. 

All IPFS file uploads were done using Pinata and verified via returned CID links.
